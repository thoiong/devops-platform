# Forming end-to-end process automation from the ground up
4 key tasks: 
* setting up system automation foundation
* automating tasks that were part of the end-to-end process
* orchestrating overall process, and 
* continuous improvement or iterative & incremental implementation

System Automation foundation enables tasks to be done, carry out on the right place.  Tasks automation involves developing command line interface for the  individual tasks of the end-to-end process.  Overall process orchestration connects the tasks of an end-to-end process into a logical orchestrated flow, ensures tasks are carried out in the right sequence, and provides turn-key operational triggers such as: started when code commit, or by system's schedulers or as a self-served button
 
The construction involves studying current practice of the end-to-end process to be automated, understanding existing system automation foundation, and boundary conditions, etc.  This usually involves working with the stakeholders, domain experts, reading system's design & operational documentations, and fitting into the company's IT & security policies.

The result is a highlevel process flow mapping and implementation strategy to guide continuous process improvement or iteratively incremental implementation
